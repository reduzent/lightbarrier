Light barriers with Arduino
===========================

The .pde files found in this repository are arduino programs that
are supposed to run on an arduino board with attached IR-LEDs on
the outputs and IR-transistors (with the proper circuitry) on the
analog inputs.

The software detects if the light beam between the corresponding
IR-LED/IR-transistor pair is interrupted. A change of state of any 
pair is written to the serial port (a.k.a USB).

The Pd patches show how two such light barriers can be used to detect
the direction of a passing object.


When using standard IR-LEDs, the whole setup can be powered solely
by the USB port. No external power supply needed.


TODO:
 * proper documentation
 * clean-up of Pd patches
 * clean-up of arduino code
 * provide circuits for LED driver and transistors
